# 5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test
#  and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

#car = 'subaru'
#print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
#print(car == 'subaru')
#print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
#print(car == 'audi')

team = 'chelsea'
print("Is team == chelsea, I predict it to be yes")
print(team == "chelsea")
print("is team == car?, i predict it to be NO")
print("team == car")

#5-2. More Conditional Tests: You donâ€™t have to limit the number of tests you create to ten. If you want to try more comparisons,
#  write more tests and add them to conditional_tests.py. Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:


#Tests for equality and inequality with strings
